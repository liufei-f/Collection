    "# The fixation index\n",
    "The fixation index ($F_{ST}$) is a measure of population differentiation due to genetic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "$F_{ST}$ essentially measures the level of genetic differentiation between two or more populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "It ranges from 0 (i.e. no genetic differentiation) to 1 (complete genetic differentiation)\n",
